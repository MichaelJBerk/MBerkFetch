- [Screenshot/Video here]

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

- I prioritized data/image fetching and caching compared to the UI, as I felt it would be signifigantly more complex than the UI.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

- It took around three hours for me to do the project. I allocated my time by focusing more on the fetching and caching functionality, rather than the UI

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

- I would have wanted to polish up the UI a little bit more, but I'm pretty happy with where it is.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

- I think I could have had some more robust error handling code when dealing with reading/writing to local files

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

- I love the fact I'm given a take-home project rather than a leetcode-style assement!
